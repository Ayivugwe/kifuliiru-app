# Kifuliiru App

Kifuliiru App is an application for the Kifuliiru language. This language is one of the languages spoken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the South Kivu province, in Uvira terriotry. It's spoken by the Bafuliiru or the Fuliiru people. My aim is prviding a portal where people are going to find all kinds of information about this language.

The Kifuliiru language is my mother language. Being that it has a limited quantity of content, I know that I am not supe intelligent or with all powers, but I believe that the little that I can contribute is going to add to what has already been done and then help others grow and explore other ways in which they may help our mother language.

I started this project of a mobile app while I was already working on this project in general. I called the main project: Tumenye Ibufuliiru which means Let's know Ibufuliiru. Ibufuliiru is our kingdom. Most of my projects I only use Ibufuliiru as their name to make it easier for me and for anyone else. So, if you want to give it a look, a simple Googlke search is going to bring one of the multiple places where we are on the Internet, like on social media or our websites.

After finding that there was almost no information on the Internet with the word IBUFULIIRU, I decided to change that by first creating content. I know that I still have a long way to go but what I have already achieved is a sign that we are approaching the top of the mountain, the mountain of creating content in Kifuliiru.

After working by myself, our found out that there are many others Bafuliiru who are interested in help to grow the Kifuliiru language. Woth the help of social media and having access to the internet, today we have more than one thousand people following the work that I initiated. You can check this at the Facebook page of Ibufuliiru.

We still have a lot of things to do, and we are looking for those who may be ready to helps us reach our goal.

In the near future I'm going to give the details of what we are looking for and what this app is intended to achieve, as this serves us as our plan.
